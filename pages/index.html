  Benefits at a Glance
</h2>

<div class="demo-text left">  
  <h6>Save Time - Installs in Seconds.</h6>
  <div>
    PlusPanda works like a widget. Just add a piece of custom code wherever you want your testimonials to appear and that's it!
    
    <br/><br/>Sample Code:<br/>
    <textarea style="width:99%; height:80px; border:1px solid #777; background:#ffffcc;font-size:0.9em"><%= @embed_code %></textarea>
  
  </div>
  
  <h6>Collect Testimonials Like a Pro.</h6>
  <div>
    All widgets include an "add your own testimonial" button that
    opens up a window for users to create a testimonial. 
    Pluspanda notifies you via email whenever a testimonial is made.
    Testimonials are hidden until <em>you</em> publish them.
    You also get an external link to add testimonials:
    <a href="{{ data.collect_url }}" target="_blank" title="Add testimonials to your website via pluspanda.">Add your testimonial</a>
  </div>
  
  <h6>Improve Organization - Make Mom Proud.</h6>
  <div>
    Keep track of hundreds of testimonials via the pluspanda manager.
    Only show the ones you want, hide the rest. Edit, delete, publish, unpublish,
    or just browse to see how many happy customers you've earned &lt;3; your mother would be proud.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="demo-text right">
  <h6>Maintain Your Brand - 99% Customizable.</h6>
  <div>
    You have <em>full</em> access to your widget's HTML and CSS.
    Pluspanda has a staging environment so you can play with your theme
    all you want and view changes without affecting the published view. Then publish the real deal when you're ready!
  </div>

  <h6>Keep Fresh - Change is Good (and easy).</h6>
  <div>
    Control everything from one central admin panel.
    Never have the same handful of ancient testimonials you spent 3 weeks getting again!
    Change themes, HTML, CSS, hide/show new testimonials.
    A freshly updated website shows customers your company is alive and kicking!
  </div>
  
  <h6>Prioritize - You Have Better Things to Do.</h6>
  <div style="font-style:italic;">
    Adding testimonials to your website is a simple task.
    Ok, so maybe we aren't winning Nobel prizes here, and you can 
    certainly whip up a page with your nice testimonials in a couple of hours -
    but you have priorities indeed.
    
    <br/><br/>
    PlusPanda <u>trivializes</u> this one simple marketing strategy so you can
    concentrate on implementing other strategies.
    You <u>know</u> you have better things to do! 
    <br/>So let us handle it, we are good at it. Thanks!
